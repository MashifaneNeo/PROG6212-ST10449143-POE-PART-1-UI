Usage
This is a prototype and does not function. It is intended to visually demonstrate the:
User Interface (UI) - the look and feel of the application.
User Experience (UX) - the flow and navigation between different areas.
Layout and Design System - the consistent use of components, colors, and typography.
You can click through the navigation and use the sidebar to see every one of the designed screens. Buttons and forms are purely layout items and will not save or process any data.
